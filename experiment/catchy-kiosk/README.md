* Add screens in between games
* Add sounds
* lock convention center to left side of screen
* Fade in entire screen on page load
* Move droppables back in front of player
* Droppables spacing should be consistent (need to figure out centering of droppable svgs)

* SVG scaling should happen with css width & height, not transform scale
* Fix droppable shadows when shrinking
